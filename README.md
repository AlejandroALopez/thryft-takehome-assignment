Thryft take-home assignment, by Alejandro (Alex) Lopez

Deployed on Vercel:

## Design choices

Followed Figma design for the form screen, the confirmation modal, and the confirmation page. Mobile responsive. Minimal styling for package components.

## Limitations

- 3 hours for the assignment
- Unclear requirement about packages feature

## Ideas for improvement

- Style for package components
- A more clear direction on the packages data (had to make it up)

## How would I approach it with more time/resources

- GraphQL backend
- Better styling for package components
- On a successful submit, send an email to the address provided with shipment info
